= Menki - A blogging base for the discerning developer

http://menkiblog.com

Inspired by Enki, it's fashionable cousin, Menki is a base to build your own blog.

No configuring or funky template languages... just cold hard Merb and
Datamapping goodness. No need to extend it with plugins, simply fork and rebase when necessary.

What Menki's got, and for good reasons:

* Merb
* Datamapper for the model
* OpenID for the admin (multiple logins)
* HAML with Î¼Formats for the pretty bits (HAML == less code == cleaner merging)
* /posts/post-title URLs
* Choice of post format: HAML, Markdown, Textile or straight HTML

Currently on the TODO list:

* Comments
* An admin (only login/logout is completed so far)

Features that'll you'll never see:

* A stylsheet - 
* Pages - you can add easily add these yourself
